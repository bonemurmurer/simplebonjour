this is a simple pure-data external that enables support for
the bonjour zeroconf implementation within a user's patch.

UPDATES:
10/20/10, murray
services may now be resolved with non-local domains
added error message
amended readme
general code cleanup

INSTALL:
1. make sure to edit makefile with the location of your pd's sources
2. install bonjour support for your operating system (specifically dns_sd.h)
   these are generally referred to as 'bonjour compatibility' libraries
   for example, on Ubuntu package to install is "libavahi-compat-libdnssd1"
3. $ make
4. make sure simplebonjour is in pd's startup path

OPERATION:
simplebonjour is extremely simple.  

it will allow you to perform two actions
find available services of specific type
resolve discovered services

send a message containing "browse _yourservice._type" to the object's inlet.  shortly all discovered services will be output as symbols thru right outlet. send a message containing "resolve your-servicename" to the object's inlet. optionally, a domain may be specified in the same message following the service name. default domain is .local, it should be specified as "resolve your-servicename local". if resolution succeeds a float containing the service's port number will output from simplebonjour's left outlet. then continue to configure remaining ports and prefixes in pure-data!
